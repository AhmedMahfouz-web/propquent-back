# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This comprehensive enhancement transforms the existing Laravel-Filament real estate project management system into a sophisticated client-facing investment platform designed for a property investment company that needs to track, manage, and report on client investments and returns. The system serves as the backend infrastructure for showing clients their property investment performance, profits, and portfolio status.

**Client Investment Reporting System**: Implementation of a comprehensive reporting infrastructure that generates client-specific investment reports, profit statements, portfolio performance analytics, and return calculations. The reporting system will provide detailed insights into individual client investments, property performance, dividend distributions, capital appreciation, and comparative market analysis.

**Investment Dashboard Modernization**: Complete redesign of the administrative dashboard by removing generic Filament widgets and implementing investment-focused widgets that track client portfolios, investment performance, profit distributions, and property status updates. The dashboard will serve investment managers who need to monitor client accounts, track property performance, and manage investment returns.

**Project Identification for Client Communication**: Transition from auto-generated UUID project identifiers to meaningful, client-friendly project codes that can be easily referenced in client communications, investment statements, and marketing materials. This enables clear project identification for both internal management and client-facing documents.

**Client-Focused Feature Integration**: Addition of features specifically designed for investment management including client portfolio tracking, profit calculation engines, investment performance analytics, automated client reporting, and tools for managing client communications about their property investments.

The enhancement is designed to serve investment managers, client relationship managers, and financial analysts who need to track client investments, calculate returns, generate client reports, and provide transparent investment performance data to property investment clients. The system will enable the company to efficiently manage multiple client investments across various properties while providing professional-grade reporting and analytics.
