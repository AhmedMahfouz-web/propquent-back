    -   Map navigation menu items related to these reports
    -   Document dependencies between reports and other system components
    -   _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2_

-   [x] 3. Modify Filament panel provider for conditional page registration

    -   Update the Filament panel provider to check configuration before registering report pages
    -   Implement conditional logic to exclude disabled report pages
    -   Ensure that the registration code is maintainable and follows best practices
    -   _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

-   [x] 4. Update widget registration for conditional loading

    -   Modify widget registration to check configuration before adding report widgets
    -   Implement conditional logic to exclude widgets for disabled reports

-   [ ] 5. Update navigation menu registration

    -   Modify navigation menu registration to check configuration before adding report links
    -   Implement conditional logic to exclude navigation items for disabled reports
    -   Ensure menu structure remains logical after removing items
    -   _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

-   [ ] 6. Handle dependencies and references to disabled reports

    -   Identify any code that references or depends on the disabled reports
    -   Implement graceful fallbacks or conditional logic where needed
    -   Ensure no errors occur when reports are disabled
    -   _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1, 3.2_

-   [ ] 7. Create unit tests for configuration system

    -   Write tests to verify configuration loading works correctly
    -   Test that report visibility flags are properly read
    -   Verify that configuration changes are reflected in the application behavior
    -   _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1, 3.3_

-   [ ] 8. Create feature tests for UI verification

    -   Write tests to verify disabled reports are not accessible via direct URLs
    -   Test that disabled report widgets are not displayed on the dashboard
    -   Verify that navigation menu does not contain links to disabled reports
    -   _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2_

-   [ ] 9. Test re-enabling functionality

    -   Verify that reports can be re-enabled through configuration changes
    -   Test that re-enabled reports function correctly
    -   Ensure no data loss occurs when toggling report visibility
    -   _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

-   [ ] 10. Update documentation
    -   Document the configuration options for report visibility
