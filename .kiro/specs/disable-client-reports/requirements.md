# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves disabling and hiding several client-related reports and their associated widgets and pages that are no longer needed in the system. The reports to be disabled include client investments, client portfolio report, investment performance report, profit distribution report, client statement report, and property performance report. This change will streamline the user interface by removing unused functionality and focus the system on the active reports.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to disable unused client-related reports so that the system interface is cleaner and more focused on active reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the reports section THEN the system SHALL NOT display the following reports:

    - Client investments report
    - Client portfolio report
    - Investment performance report
    - Profit distribution report
    - Client statement report
    - Property performance report

2. WHEN a user views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL NOT display any widgets related to the disabled reports.

3. WHEN a user accesses the navigation menu THEN the system SHALL NOT show links to any of the disabled reports.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly disable the report functionality rather than just hiding the UI elements, so that system resources are not wasted on unused features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL NOT register or initialize any of the disabled report services.

2. WHEN the application builds the admin panel THEN the system SHALL NOT register any of the disabled report pages or widgets.

3. IF any other part of the system previously depended on these reports THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle their absence without errors.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the disabling process to be reversible if needed in the future, so that we can restore functionality without major development effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN disabling the reports THEN the system SHALL use configuration-based approaches where possible rather than removing code entirely.

2. WHEN implementing the disabling mechanism THEN the system SHALL maintain all database tables and structures related to the reports.

3. IF the reports need to be re-enabled in the future THEN the system SHALL allow this through configuration changes rather than requiring new code development.
