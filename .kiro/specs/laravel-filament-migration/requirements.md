# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating an existing Laravel application with Filament admin interface to a new Laravel 12 project with Filament beta version. The current application appears to be a real estate investment management system with user authentication, project management, transaction tracking, and developer management capabilities. The migration needs to preserve all existing functionality while upgrading to the latest Laravel and Filament versions.

5. WHEN migrating database schema THEN the system SHALL include media library tables for file management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate all Filament resources and admin interface components to the new project with Filament beta compatibility, so that the admin interface functionality is preserved.

5. WHEN migrating Filament resources THEN the system SHALL preserve file upload functionality with proper disk configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate all configuration files and dependencies to the new Laravel 12 project, so that the application maintains the same functionality and integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new Laravel 12 project to be properly structured and follow Laravel 12 conventions, so that future development and maintenance is streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the new project THEN the system SHALL use Laravel 12 project structure and conventions
2. WHEN setting up the new project THEN the system SHALL configure proper autoloading and namespacing
