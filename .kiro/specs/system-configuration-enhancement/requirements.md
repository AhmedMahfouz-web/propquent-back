# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the real estate project management system by making it more dynamic and configurable. The system will allow administrators to manage various configuration options through a settings page, simplify project statuses, redesign project reports to match financial report structure, fix theme switching issues, add relevant widgets, and seed realistic data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure project statuses dynamically, so that I can adapt the system to changing business needs without code modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the system settings page THEN the system SHALL display a section for managing project statuses
2. WHEN an administrator adds a new project status THEN the system SHALL save it to the database and make it available for project assignment
3. WHEN an administrator edits an existing project status THEN the system SHALL update all references and maintain data integrity
4. WHEN an administrator deletes a project status THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if projects are using that status
5. IF no projects are using a status THEN the system SHALL allow deletion of that status
6. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL only have two default project statuses: "exited" and "on-going"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure transaction types, property types, and other categorical data dynamically, so that I can customize the system for different business scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the system settings page THEN the system SHALL display sections for managing all categorical data types
2. WHEN an administrator adds a new category item THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness and save it to the database
3. WHEN an administrator edits a category item THEN the system SHALL update all references while maintaining data relationships
4. WHEN an administrator attempts to delete a category item in use THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show a warning message
5. WHEN the system loads forms THEN it SHALL populate dropdowns with current dynamic configuration values
6. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes across all relevant interfaces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to view project reports in the same format as financial reports, so that I can analyze project data consistently with financial data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses project reports THEN the system SHALL display data in a monthly grid format similar to financial reports
2. WHEN viewing project reports THEN the system SHALL show months as columns and project metrics as rows
3. WHEN a user selects a date range THEN the system SHALL filter project data accordingly and update the monthly view
4. WHEN project data is displayed THEN the system SHALL aggregate metrics by month for clear visualization
5. WHEN no data exists for a month THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state indicators
6. WHEN users interact with the report THEN the system SHALL provide the same navigation and filtering capabilities as financial reports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme switcher to work properly, so that I can choose between light and dark modes without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the theme switcher THEN the system SHALL immediately change the theme without page reload
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain the previously selected theme
3. WHEN a user switches themes THEN the system SHALL persist the preference in browser storage
4. WHEN the system loads THEN it SHALL apply the user's saved theme preference or default to system preference
5. WHEN theme changes occur THEN all UI components SHALL properly reflect the new theme colors and styles

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to see widgets that are relevant to the updated system configuration, so that I can quickly understand key metrics and system status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display widgets showing current project status distribution
2. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show widgets for transaction summaries based on dynamic transaction types
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display widgets showing recent activity and trends
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN dashboard widgets SHALL automatically reflect the updated categories
5. WHEN widgets display data THEN the system SHALL use the current dynamic configuration for categorization and filtering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer or tester, I want realistic seed data that reflects current dates and business scenarios, so that I can properly test and demonstrate the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database seeding runs THEN the system SHALL create projects with realistic current and recent dates
2. WHEN seeding transactions THEN the system SHALL generate entries with dates spanning the last 12 months
3. WHEN creating seed data THEN the system SHALL use the new simplified project statuses (exited, on-going)
4. WHEN seeding runs THEN the system SHALL create varied transaction types and amounts that reflect realistic business scenarios
5. WHEN seed data is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure proper relationships between projects, developers, and transactions
6. WHEN seeding completes THEN the system SHALL have sufficient data to demonstrate all reporting and dashboard features

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a centralized settings page with theme switcher and configuration options, so that I can manage all system settings from one location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses settings THEN the system SHALL display a organized settings page with clear sections
2. WHEN viewing settings THEN the system SHALL show the theme switcher alongside other configuration options
3. WHEN administrators make changes THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and validation
4. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL confirm successful updates and refresh relevant UI components
5. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL require appropriate administrative permissions
6. WHEN the settings page loads THEN it SHALL display current configuration values for all manageable categories
